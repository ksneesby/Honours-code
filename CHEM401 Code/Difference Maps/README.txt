This folder contains scripts which compare cluster maps between HCHO and each of the other variables. This comparison is of all clusters simultaneously, and as clusters do not align perfectly between variables, differences depend heavily on cluster assignment. Scripts included are:
* HCHO and EF Clustering Difference Map
* HCHO and LAI Clustering Difference Map
* HCHO and PFT Clustering Difference Map
* HCHO and SM Clustering Difference Map
