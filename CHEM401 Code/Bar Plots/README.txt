This folder contains scripts which create bar plots to show cluster breakdowns. Scripts included in this folder are:
* EF Bar Plots
* HCHO Bar Plots
* LAI Bar Plots
* SM Bar Plots
Creates bar plots for the variables which shows the average mean and interannual standard deviation for each cluster.

* PFT Bar Plots
Stacked bar plot which shows the distribution of each PFT in each cluster.

* Driving Variables on HCHO cluster grid Bar Plots
Creates bar plots for each variable using the variables average mean and interannual standard deviation, but using the clusters determined in the HCHO clustering.
